# UX Story 001: Initial Goose Integration Test

**Version:** v0.1.0-rc6  
**Interface Type:** memory-proxy (STDIO)  
**Client:** Goose CLI (anthropic/claude-3.5 via OpenRouter)  
**Session Start:** 1:20 PM EST, Friday, May 9th, 2025

## Summary

This UX Story captures the initial integration and user experience testing of `memory-server` via the `memory-proxy` STDIO interface, using Goose CLI with the foundational model anthropic/claude-3.5 fulfilled via OpenRouter.

## Objectives

- Validate basic memory operations: `remember` and `recall`
- Confirm semantic vector search capabilities
- Assess usability and ergonomics from Goose CLI's perspective

## Key Outcomes

### Successes:
- Semantic search performed exceptionally, returning relevant memories regardless of phrasing.
- Dual CLI/AI interface recognized as intuitive and practical for collaborative workflows.
- JSON schema interface clear and functional.

### Issues Identified:
- Tags in recall caused backend errors (known issue).
- Pagination logic starts at page 1 instead of standard 0, potentially confusing users.
- Occasionally inconsistent pagination behavior (1 or 3 results returned with pageSize=1).

## Goose Feedback

### Rating
- Overall experience rating: **8/10**
- Goose NPS Score: **9/10 (Promoter)**

### Ergonomic Highlights
- Clear separation of metadata and content in API.
- Flexible semantic search functionality.

### Recommendations
- Rename tool endpoints for clearer semantics (`memory_store.recall`, `memory_store.remember`).
- Add additional convenience methods (`memory.list`, `memory.stats`).
- Fix pagination offset to standard 0-based indexing.
- Implement batch memory operations and update/delete functionalities.

### Closing Remarks

"The semantic search is powerful and intuitive. The dual-interface setup and planned support for teams and namespaces suggest robust future utility. Highly recommended for collaborative agent workflows."

## Actionable Next Steps
- Correct recall logic to appropriately handle tags.
- Standardize and document pagination logic.
- Begin incremental improvements based on Goose recommendations.
